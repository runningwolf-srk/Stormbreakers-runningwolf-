        title: "THE BLOOD", 
        text: "Every thorn drew blood. Every drop paid for rebellion you couldn't cover. This wasn't a minor cut. This was the curse of Genesis 3:18 — thorns from the ground — being crushed on His brow. Your addiction, your shame, your sin drew blood first from His skull."

        title: "THE LION", 
        text: "The same one who was slain now roars. The grave couldn't hold Him. Death couldn't keep Him. The Lion of Judah has triumphed. When you worship from your wounds, you don't sound like a victim. You sound like victory. He roars through your surrender."
      },
      {
        title: "THE THRONE",
        text: "He rules not by force, but by sacrifice. The scars are His credentials. He conquered by surrendering. He rules by serving. That's Kingdom logic. Stop trying to be the lion. Let the Lamb in you become the Lion through you."
      },
      {
        title: "THE PARADOX",
        text: "He's not coming back as a lamb. He's coming back as a King. Your fire right now? That's the Lion roaring. Your tears last night? That's the Lamb weeping. Both are Him. Both are you when you're in Him."

      {
        title: "THE RECONCILING", 
        text: "Colossians says He reconciled ALL things. Your past. Your family. Your future. Your addiction. Your trauma. Nothing is too far. The blood doesn’t just cover sin — it makes peace where there was war. Between you and God. Between you and yourself."
      },
      {
        title: "THE COVENANT",
        text: "This is why the enemy hates communion. Why he hates worship. Why he hates this song. Because every time you remember the blood, you’re reminding hell it lost. You’re not trying to get clean. You ARE clean. The blood of the cross says so."
